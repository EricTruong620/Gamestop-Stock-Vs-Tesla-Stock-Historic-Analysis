# Gamestop-Stock-Vs-Tesla-Stock-Historic-Analysis
This repository contains the Python notebook file for my capstone project for the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

**Project Description**
<br>
Determining the price of a stock is a multifaceted process influenced by various factors, including a company's outstanding shares, future profit potential, and market sentiment. One investment strategy, known as short selling, involves profiting from declining stock prices. Hedge funds often employ this technique, but it carries risks when stock prices rise unexpectedly. This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard for comparing stock prices and hedge fund profits, focusing on the cases of Tesla and GameStop.
